# Practice 1: Proof recursive _μ_ and _σ_.

Empirical demonstration of the equivalence of the standard and recursive functions of _μ_ and _σ_.

## GitHub: [Practice 1](https://github.com/dayan3847/bayes_estimator/tree/main/practice1) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dayan3847/bayes_estimator/blob/master/practice1/practice1.ipynb)

## Steps:

* Generate a random _μ_ and _σ_.
* Generate a quantity _N_ of random samples from a normal distribution with the parameters _μ_ and _σ_.
* Calculate the mean and variance of the samples generated in a non-recursive way.
* Calculate the mean and variance of the samples generated in a recursive way.
* Graph the mean and variance of the samples generated in a non-recursive and recursive way.
* Compare the results obtained.

## Conclusion:

It has been demonstrated using the method of mathematical induction.
We have shown that if the formulas are equivalent for _n = k_, then they are also equivalent for _n = k + 1_.
Since we have already shown that they are equivalent for _n = 1_ (base step),
we can conclude that the iterative and recursive formulas for calculating $\mu$ are equivalent for any value of $n$,
therefore, they are equally valid.
